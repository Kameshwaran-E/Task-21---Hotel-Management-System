        <h1>About</h1>A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on
        a short-term basis. Facilities provided inside a hotel room may range
        from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with
        bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a refrigerator, and other
        kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flat-screen television, and
        en-suite bathrooms. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most
        basic guest services and facilities.
